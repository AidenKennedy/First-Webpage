<u><b>Patriots Recievers Struggles:</b></u>
<body>Last year, the New England Patriots faced a number of injuries and suspenstions. This was mainly seen in their recieveig core. Examples of this include Edelman's 4 game suspension, Josh Gordon's leave of absence, and Gronkowski's recuring injuries. This caused the Patriots to adjust their gameplan to be centered around runningbacks White and Michel.</body>

<u><b>Tom Brady's Old Age:</b></u>
<body>By the start of this NFL season, Tom Brady will be 42 years old. This means that it is essential to surround him with talented playmaking recievers who can get yards after the catch.</body>

<li>
<u><b>Josh Gordon's Potential:</b></u>  
<body>Josh is just good. In 2013 (his last whole season without a suspension) Josh was able to accumulate 1646 yards from 87 receptions making him arguably the best reciever that year. Now that he has been reinstated, the Patriots are optomistic that he will be able to play the whole season.</body>
